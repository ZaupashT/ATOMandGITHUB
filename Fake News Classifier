News media have long been a vital channel for disseminating information about world events to the public. People often trust that the
 news they consume is accurate and truthful. However, there have been instances where even reputable news outlets have had to retract
 stories that were later found to be false. The implications of false news can be profound, affecting not only individuals and
 governments but also entire economies. A single news story can sway public sentiment and influence political and economic
 landscapes significantly. This underscores the importance of distinguishing fake news from genuine news.
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools have emerged as powerful solutions to this problem. By leveraging historical data, NLP can
 help identify and filter out fake news, ensuring that the information reaching the public is credible. With the advent of these
 technologies, the integrity of news dissemination is increasingly safeguarded, contributing to a more informed and stable society.
